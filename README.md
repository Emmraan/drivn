### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (package manager)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (local instance or cloud URI)
-   [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/) for S3 (or a compatible S3 provider like Cloudflare R2, Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces, MinIO, Tebi, Backblaze, etc.)

### Quick Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Emmraan/drivn.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd drivn
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Copy environment template**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.sample .env.local
    ```

5.  Configure your `.env.local` file with your environment variables.

6.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

7.  **Open in browser**:
    Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project based on the `.env.sample` template.

#### Optional: External Validation Service

```env
VALIDATION_STRONG=false # Set to true to enable external validation
VALIDATOR_API_KEY=your-validator-api-key-here
VALIDATOR_URL=https://your-validator-url-here.com/api/validate
```
#### For more detail about External Validation Service see our [form-validator repository](https://github.com/Emmraan/form-validator)

**Note**: For production deployments, ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET` are strong, randomly generated strings, and consider additional security measures for email services.

## üöÄ Deployment

DRIVN can be easily deployed to various platforms.
